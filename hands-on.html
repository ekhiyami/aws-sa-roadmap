                    <p>This is a list of workshops that covers the <strong>core AWS services</strong> on the main domains every Solutions Architect should know about. These workshops are <strong>authored by AWS experts</strong> and used to train both AWS customers and AWS technical field. They are designed with <strong>self step-by-step guides</strong> and will help you enforce your learning by implementing actual working scenarios.</p>

                    <h3>Here are some ideas on how you can use these workshops:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>After you study the concept</strong>, let's say Storage, from books or videos, select the storage workshop and complete it</li>
                        <li><strong>As you go through the workshop</strong>, if you like a piece of implementation of a scenario, you can use it to talk about to build your online portfolio, post about it on LinkedIn or YouTube</li>
                        <li><strong>If you feel very strong about the scenario</strong>, you can add it to your resume or build something similar</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <div class="key-benefit">
                        <p><strong>After completing these workshops, you will gain deep hands-on experience on the core services of AWS.</strong></p>

                    <h4>AWS Core Services Overview</h4>
                    <p>For week 1, lets start with getting the grasp on AWS foundational services and especially Amazon EC2!!</p>
                    <p>Get your hands dirty with AWS General Immersion Day workshop.</p>
                    <p>The hands-on labs are divided into basic and advanced modules.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In basic modules, you will learn various features of AWS foundational services.</li>
                        <li>In advanced modules, you will learn how to connect each service organically to create architecture like a 3-tier web application.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you are starting your AWS journey, try and complete the labs in Basic modules- specially the core services - compute, networking, security, database and storage. We will dive deep into these core services in subsequent workshops.</p>
                    <p>If you are further along in your AWS learning journey, I will recommend you to do the cost management labs and the advanced module - web application.</p>

                    <h4>Identity and Access Management</h4>
                    <p>Now that we have covered AWS foundational services in week 1, lets dive deep into AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) in week 2.</p>
                    <p>In this IAM Immersion Day workshop, through a mix of service explanations and hands-on labs, you will learn about AWS Identity And Access Management (IAM) and how to govern at scale.</p>
                    <p><strong>Key topics covered in this workshop:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Programmatic access to AWS</li>
                        <li>IAM fundamentals and core concepts</li>
                        <li>Best practices for the root user account</li>
                        <li>IAM identities and when to use each option</li>
                        <li>IAM policies and how permissions are granted</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The hands-on labs in the workshop are divided into Basic and Advanced Modules, so you can start based on where you are in your learning journey.</p>
                    <p>By the end of this workshop, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and learn how to effectively govern at scale.</p>
